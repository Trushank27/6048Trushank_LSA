  -The main purpose of this server is to share the files or the printers so that they could be used efficiently.


Steps :

1) Install the samba package
     >>sudo apt-get update
     >>sudo apt-get install samba

2) Create a directory for it to share
     >>mkdir /home/kali/xyz/

   Create two or three files to test

3) The configuration file. Have to add the directory we want to share.
    >>sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

   Add this to the end of the file.
